title: DuckDB Settings
---

The `duckdb_execute` function can be used to change the underlying [configuration options](https://duckdb.org/docs/configuration/overview#global-configuration-options)
used by DuckDB.

```sql
-- Dollar quoted strings are used to escape single quotes
SELECT duckdb_execute($$SET memory_limit='10GiB'$$);
```

`duckdb_settings` returns a table of all available settings.

```sql
SELECT * FROM duckdb_settings();
```

<Note>
  Because a new DuckDB connection is created per Postgres connection, every new
  Postgres connection uses the default DuckDB configuration. Changes to the
  DuckDB configuration only apply to the current Postgres connection.
